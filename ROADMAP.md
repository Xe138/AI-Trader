# AI-Trader Roadmap

This document outlines planned features and improvements for the AI-Trader project.

## Release Planning

### v0.4.0 - Enhanced Simulation Management (Planned)

**Focus:** Improved simulation control, resume capabilities, and performance analysis

  - Query parameters to specify which model(s) to continue
  - Automatic detection of last completed date per model
  - Validation to prevent overlapping simulations
  - Support for extending date ranges forward in time
  - Use cases:
    - Daily simulation updates (add today's date to existing run)
    - Recovering from failed jobs (resume from interruption point)
    - Incremental backtesting (extend historical analysis)

#### Data Management
- **Price Data Management API** - Endpoints for price data operations
  - `GET /data/coverage` - Check date ranges available per symbol
  - `POST /data/download` - Trigger manual price data downloads
  - `GET /data/status` - Check download progress and rate limits
  - `DELETE /data/range` - Remove price data for specific date ranges
